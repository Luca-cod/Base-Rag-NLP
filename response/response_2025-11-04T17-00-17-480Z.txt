I'll follow the guidelines and provide an accurate analysis based on the provided context.

The query "When the temperature exceeds 25°, turn on the air conditioner" seems to be related to a thermostat or a temperature control system. However, I need more information about the specific device or system being referred to.

From the provided data, it appears that there is only one parameter mentioned: "setpoint". The value of this parameter is set to 25°C.

Since the query specifically mentions turning on the air conditioner when the temperature exceeds 25°C, and there is no mention of a separate device or operation for this specific action, I will not be able to provide any further information about how to implement this in the system.
