I'll follow the guidelines and provide an accurate analysis based on the provided context.

The query "When the temperature exceeds 25°, turn on the air conditioner" seems to be related to a thermostat or a temperature control system. However, I need more information about the specific device or system being referred to.

From the provided data, it appears that there is only one parameter mentioned in the query: "setpoint". This value is specified as 25°C.

The "setpoint" parameter is documented under the following parameters:

* Parameters (8): 
  * temperatura (celsius) Type: 1
  * setpoint (celsius) Type: Unknown

Since the "setpoint" parameter is not explicitly mentioned in the query, I will only return this information.

The absence of any other relevant information about the thermostat or temperature control system makes it impossible to provide a more detailed analysis.
