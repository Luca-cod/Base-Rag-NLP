I'll follow the guidelines and provide an accurate analysis based on the provided context.

The query "When the temperature exceeds 25°, turn on the air conditioner" seems to be related to a thermostat or a temperature control system. However, I need more information about the specific device or system being referred to.

From the provided data, it appears that there are multiple devices with similar names and categories, such as:

* Thermostat (category: controller)
* Temperature sensor (partitions: d554afab-f66c-40c9-b868-56a64b08bc4e)

However, I couldn't find any information about a device called "air conditioner" in the context.

Since there is no explicit mention of an air conditioner or its parameters, I will not be able to provide a specific answer.
