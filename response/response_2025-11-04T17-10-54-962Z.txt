I'll follow the guidelines and provide an accurate analysis based on the provided context.

The query "When the temperature exceeds 25°, turn on the air conditioner" seems to be related to a thermostat or a temperature control system. However, I need more information about the specific device or system being referred to.

From the provided data, it appears that there is only one parameter mentioned in the query: "setpoint". The value of this parameter is 25°C.

The "setpoint" parameter seems to be related to the thermostat's temperature setting. However, I couldn't find any information about an "air conditioner" being controlled by this device. It's possible that there are other devices or systems that control air conditioning in the system.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would need more context or information about the specific device or system being referred to. If you could provide additional details or clarify which device is being asked about, I'll do my best to assist you.

In general, based on the provided data, it seems that there are no explicit references to an "air conditioner" being controlled by this thermostat. The only information available is related to temperature settings and other parameters of the thermostat itself.
