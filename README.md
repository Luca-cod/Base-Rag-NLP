# RAG-LangChain-NaturalLanguageResponseFormat
It's a RAG-Langchain version with return a Natural Language response format
This is the base implementation of the RAG — the fundamental structure and minimal setup needed to use an LLM via RAG with the LangChain framework.

This version serves as a simple foundation for a RAG + Langchain system, into which function modules can be added to improve system performance.
We can see it as a starting point from which to expand the code with various features, as seen in the more extensive versions.
